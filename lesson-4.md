Pandas is a Python library that allows the loading, processing and wrangling of data. With Pandas you can gain access to data from a multitude of input sources such as CSV, TSV, Excel, SQL databases, JSON, etc. Afterwards, data can be exported out in the aforementioned formats as well.

## Installing Pandas

Let's start by installing Pandas that can be performed as follows:

```
pip install pandas
```

## Using Pandas

To start using Pandas, we can import Pandas as follows:
```Python
import pandas as pd
```

## Pandas Data Structure

Pandas allow us to work with tabular datasets. Let us take a look at the basic data structures of Pandas that consists of 3 types as follows (i.e. the first two are the data structures while the latter serves as a point of reference):
<img src="./img/lesson-4-pandas-data-structure.png" alt="Pandas Data Structures" width="500" align="right"/>
1. Series
2. DataFrame
3. Index

In a nutshell, you will see that a ***Pandas DataFrame*** and ***Pandas Series*** are labeled data (i.e. it has row names and column names). 

Youâ€™ll also see that a ***Pandas DataFrame*** is a collection of Pandas Series (i.e. the individual columns and rows).

### Pandas Series

A ***Pandas Series*** is a one-dimensional array that is very much similar to the NumPy array but with the ability to be labeled (i.e. the axis label or also called the index). A Series can hold an integer, float, string, python object, etc. At a high-level, a Series can be thought of as a column in Microsoft Excel.

### Pandas DataFrame

A ***Pandas DataFrame*** is a two-dimensional array. At a high-level, a DataFrame can be thought of as the spreadsheet in Microsoft Excel (i.e. a M Ã— N matrix where M denotes the rows and N the columns).

### Pandas Index

The ***index*** in Pandas is an inherent property of Series and DataFrame objects that serves as a point of reference as to which rows and/or columns to perform operations on (i.e. for a DataFrame) or the specific element in a Series to perform operations on. By default, Pandas automatically assigns index numbers starting from 0 to denote the row numbers or column numbers (i.e. if none are explicitly defined).

## Creation of Pandas Objects

Let's create some Pandas Series and Pandas DataFrame.

### Pandas Series

By default, there are no Series name. In the *Index* section below we will be adding the Series name.

```Python
pd.Series([1,2,3,4,5])
```

```Python
pd.Series([1,2,3,4,5,3.5])
```

```Python
pd.Series([1,2,3,4,5,'a'])
```

```Python
pd.Series(['apple','papayas','bananas','orange'])
```

### Pandas DataFrame

By default, we can see that the *Index* values are integers. In the *Index* section we will be adding a label instead.

```Python
# Creating a DataFrame from a NumPy array
n1 = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
df1 = pd.DataFrame(n1)
df1
```

### Pandas Index

Let's add some meaningful labels to the columns.

**Pandas Series**

```Python
# Creating a Series from a list
l2 = [1,2,3,4,5]
s2 = pd.Series(l2, name='A')
s2
```

**Pandas DataFrame**

```Python
# Creating a DataFrame from a NumPy array
n2 = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

# Creating columns name
df2 = pd.DataFrame(n2, columns=['A', 'B', 'C'])
df2

# Creating columns and rows name
df3 = pd.DataFrame(n2, columns=['A', 'B', 'C'], index=['R1', 'R2', 'R3'])
df3
```

```Python
# Therefore to have a index with new names we will create a new DataFrame
df4 = df3.copy()
df4.index = ['John', 'Mary', 'Somchai']
df4
```

```Python
# Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary
d = {'A': [1, 2, 3], 'B': [4, 5, 6], 'C': [7, 8, 9]}
df1 = pd.DataFrame(d)
df1
```

```Python
# Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary (with Index)
d = {'A': [1, 2, 3], 'B': [4, 5, 6], 'C': [7, 8, 9]}
df1 = pd.DataFrame(d, index=['John','Somchai','Sally'])
df1
```

```Python
# Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary (with Index)
d = {'A': [1, 2, 3], 'B': [4, 5, 6], 'C': [7, 8, 9]}
df1.index = ['John','Somchai','Sally']
df1
```




## Read CSV data

Let's consider a simple use case of Pandas that I use quite often, which is to read in a CSV data:

```Python
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
```

In the above example, we are reading from a local file. However, if the CSV file is located on the cloud, it could also be read in a similar fashion. So instead of the file name, you can paste in the URL of the CSV file:

```Python
df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dataprofessor/data/master/delaney_solubility_with_descriptors.csv')
```

To display the CSV data, this is as simple as calling the `df` variable:

```Python
df
```

which should yield the following DataFrame:

</p>

As we can see, the DataFrame could be thought of as an $mÃ—n$ matrix with $m$ rows and $n$ columns.

## Selecting a single column

To select specific columns (such as the *MolWt* column) we can run the following:
```Python
df['MolLogP']
```
which produces the following Series output:

  <img src="./img/lesson-4-pandas-select-columns.png" width="45%">
</p>

## Selecting multiple columns

To select multiple columns (such as *MolWt* and *MolWt*) we can run the following:
```Python
df[['MolLogP','MolWt']]
```
which produces the following DataFrame output:
