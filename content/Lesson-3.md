# ðŸ““ Lesson 3 - Numerical processing with NumPy

NumPy is a Python library that allows you to perform numerical processing. 

Here are some of the following features that NumPy can do:
- Supports N-dimensional array and matrix data structures
- Perform various mathematical operations on arrays and matrices
- Transposing and reshaping matrices
- Random number generation
- etc.

## Installing NumPy

Let's start by installing NumPy that can be performed as follows:

```
pip install numpy
```

## Using NumPy

To start using Numpy, we can import NumPy as follows:
```Python
import numpy as np
```

## Data structures in NumPy

Let's consider a simple use case of NumPy for creating data structure known as tensors. 

Before proceeding further, let's consider the following characteristics of tensors:
- It can be thought of as a container of data that can be numerical or character. 
- It can be used to represent high-dimensional data and complex relationships between variables.
- It can be of various dimensionality (e.g. 0D, 1D, 2D and 3D).

Particularly, we'll use the `np.array()` method to create scalar, vector, matrix and a 3D tensor:
```Python
# Create a scalar (0D Tensor)
x1 = np.array(0)

# Create a vector (1D Tensor)
x2 = np.array([0, 1, 2])

# Create a matrix (2D Tensor)
x3 = np.array([0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8])

# Create a 3D Tensor
x4 = np.array([[[ 0,  1,  2],[ 3,  4,  5],[ 6,  7,  8]],
               [[ 9, 10, 11],[12, 13, 14],[15, 16, 17]],
               [[18, 19, 20],[21, 22, 23],[24, 25, 26]]])
```

As summarized above, a vector is an array of scalar, a matrix is an array of vectors and the 3D tensor is an array of matrix.

Now that we have taken a quick glance at NumPy, let's proceed to seeing how we can handle and process data.

## Array manipulation

Previously, we've created a 1-dimensional array (vector) and often times we may need to manipulate arrays to different form in order to suit different data science tasks.

Reshaping arrays will allow us to make changes to the dimensions or data structure of arrays. Particularly, let's say that if we would like to reshape a 1D array into a 2D array, we can use the `reshape()` method that takes a tuple of the new dimension as an input argument.

### Creating a 1D array

```Python
import numpy as np
x3 = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8])
```

### Determining the data type

To determine the data type of the `x3` variable that we've just created we can use the `type()` function.
```Python
type(x3)
```
This returns the following:
```
numpy.ndarray
```
which indicates the NumPy array data type.

### Reshaping 1D to 2D array

We're now going to reshape the 1D array to a 2D array using the `reshape()` method as follows:
```Python
x3.reshape((3, 3))
```
This will display the 3 by 3 data matrix (2D array) as follows:
```
array([[0, 1, 2],
       [3, 4, 5],
       [6, 7, 8]])
```

## Stacking arrays

Another operation that we can do is array stacking. Particularly, we can stack multiple arrays into a single array. You can stack arrays horizontally (i.e. along their columns) or vertically (i.e. along their rows) using the `hstack()` and vstack()` methods, respectively.
