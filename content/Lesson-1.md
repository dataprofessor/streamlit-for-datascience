## 1. What is Streamlit?

Streamlit is a Python library that you can use to build interactive data-driven web apps.

A typical workflow for the creation and deployment of Streamlit app is summarized below:

## 2. Prerequisites

Here's what you need to use Streamlit:
- Have basic Python knowledge.
- Write scripts to perform specific tasks (like taking several Excel files as input and combining them into one).
- Build and grow the Streamlit app line by line instead of starting with a predefined layout (it takes only a few lines of code).
If you can do all this, congratulations! You're ready to plunge into the world of Streamlit.

## 3. Installing Streamlit

If you already have an existing Python coding environment, Streamlit can be installed using `pip` as shown below:

```
pip install streamlit
```

## 4. Setting up your Streamlit workspace

It is typically good practice to house the Streamlit app in their own dedicated conda environment. This way the library dependencies donâ€™t get entangled with other Python libraries used by other apps.

Here, we're going to replicate a Streamlit app from an existing GitHub repo available at https://github.com/dataprofessor/eda-app/.

Particularly, we're going to clone the EDA app from a YouTube tutorial video on [*How to Build an EDA app using Pandas Profiling*](https://youtu.be/p4uohebPuCg).

**Step 1.** Create a conda environment

Create a conda environment called eda:

```
conda create -n eda python=3.7.9
```

**Step 2.** Activate the eda environment:

```
conda activate eda
```

**Step 3.** To install prerequisite libraries we must first download the requirements.txt file (it contains the library version numbers):

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dataprofessor/eda-app/main/requirements.txt
```

**Step 4.** To actually install prerequisite libraries using the requirements.txt file

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Inside the `requirements.txt` file you'll see the following contents:

```
streamlit==0.71.0
pandas==1.1.3
numpy==1.19.2
pandas-profiling==2.10.0
streamlit-pandas-profiling==0.1.1
Jinja2==3.0.3
```

You'll notice that in the above contents, we're using legacy versions of the Python libraries, which is to be expected as this is from a tutorial from 2 years ago. In spite of this, the app should still work as the specific dependent Python libraries are specified in the `requirements.txt` file.

**Step 5.** Download and unzip contents from the GitHub repo: https://github.com/dataprofessor/eda-app/archive/main.zip

**Step 6.** Launch the app:

```
streamlit run app.py
```

Youâ€™ll see the web app browser pop up:

The functionality of this EDA app leverages the capabilities of pandas-profiling. Let's take a look at the app in action:

Congratulations! You now know how to clone a Streamlit app from a GitHub repo, setup a dedicated conda environment, and successfully launch the app!

## 5. Creating your first Streamlit app

Before we get into the nuts and bolts of the Streamlit library, let's take a hands-on approach for learning how to use Streamlit. Particularly, creating a simple **Hello world app** would probably be an expected rite of passage to learning Streamlit!

It's not as difficult as you may think. In fact, it takes only 2 lines of code to do just that!

```Python
import streamlit as st
st.write('Hello world!')
```

Click on the **See code explanation** toggle button to reveal the explanatory text:

<summary>See code explanation</summary>

Here's a line-by-line breakdown of the code:
  1. Import the `streamlit` library as `st` (so that we can later refer to `streamlit` literally as `st` instead of having to type the full word `streamlit`.
  2. Use `st.write` to write a text output and inside the `st.write` command we use the `'Hello world!'` string as the input argument.

## Summary

In this lesson, we're introduced to Streamlit along with how to setup a computing environment as well as creating our first Streamlit app.
