# ðŸ““ Lesson 2 - Getting up to speed with Data Science

## 1.1. What is Data Science?

Data science boils down to the conversion of data to knowledge and insights. At a high-level, the science of data science implies that we're appying the scientific methodology to tackle data problems that essentially starts with the formulation of a working hypothesis or initial assumptions that you have. From there, you can decide which particular data to collect and perform the analysis.

This involves a series of steps and the typical data science process can best be summarized by data frameworks such as [OSEMN](https://web.archive.org/web/20211219192027/http://www.dataists.com/2010/09/a-taxonomy-of-data-science/) that encompasses the following steps involving data:
- **Obtain** - Any data projects essentially starts with access to data and one can do this by compiling a dataset based on objectives of projects.
- **Scrub** - Raw data is often messy, pre-mature and not suitable for data analysis. As a result, one must first pre-process the data such that any missing data and inconsistencies are addressed so that they are amenable for further analysis.
- **Explore** - In order to discover any meaningful insights from the data, exploring the data is often a great first step to gain an understanding of the data. This will allow the practitioner to make a well-informed decision on the next steps for further data exploration or which subset of data to used for further analysis. In some circumstances, one may discover that additional data needs to be collected.
- **Model** - Once data has been prepared and curated, the typical next steps would be to take the data and build a machine learning model that can be used to make predictions on new data.
- **iNterpret** - Probably the most impactful part is the intrepretation of the model where useful knowledge and insights are extracted from models. It should be noted that the most sophisticated machine learning algorithm may not be the best algorithm as they may not afford interpretability whereas simple algorithms such as linear regression or decision tree may provide more interpretability.

## 1.2. Toolkits for Data Science

Now that we have a fundmanetal knowledge of data science, let's take a look at the tools of the trade.

Common toolkits that are helpful for any data science projects includes the following:
Python library | Brief description | OSEMN phase
---|---|---
`NumPy` | Numerical processing | Scrub
`Pandas` | Data wrangling | Scrub
`Matplotlib` | Data visualization | Explore
`Seaborn` | Data visualization | Explore
`Plotly` | Data visualization | Explore
`Altair` | Data visualization | Explore
`Scikit-learn` | Machine learning | Model / iNterpret

These toolkits provide ready-to-use functions that can be readily harnessed to retrieve, prepare, visualize and analyze data. Without such toolkits we would have to implement our own custom functions to do the same tasks.

## 1.3. NumPy

NumPy is a Python library that allows you to perform numerical processing. 

Here are some of the following features that NumPy can do:
- Supports N-dimensional array and matrix data structures
- Perform various mathematical operations on arrays and matrices
- Transposing and reshaping matrices
- Random number generation
- etc.

### 1.3.1. Using NumPy

Let's start by installing NumPy that can be performed as follows:

```
pip install numpy
```

To start using Numpy, we can import NumPy as follows:
```Python
import numpy as np
```

Let's consider a simple use case of NumPy for creating various data structures particularly tensors. Particularly, we'll use the `np.array()` method to create scalar, vector, matrix and a 3D tensor:
```Python
# Create a scalar (0D Tensor)
x1 = np.array(0)

# Create a vector (1D Tensor)
x2 = np.array([0, 1, 2])

# Create a matrix (2D Tensor)
x3 = np.array([0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8])

# Create a 3D Tensor
x4 = np.array([[[ 0,  1,  2],[ 3,  4,  5],[ 6,  7,  8]],
               [[ 9, 10, 11],[12, 13, 14],[15, 16, 17]],
               [[18, 19, 20],[21, 22, 23],[24, 25, 26]]])
```

In essence, a vector is an array of scalar, a matrix is an array of vectors and the 3D tensor is an array of matrix.
