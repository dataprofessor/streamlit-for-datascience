# ðŸ““ Lesson 2 - Getting up to speed with Data Science

## 1.1. What is Data Science?

Data science boils down to the conversion of data to knowledge and insights. At a high-level, the science of data science implies that we're appying the scientific methodology to tackle data problems that essentially starts with the formulation of a working hypothesis or initial assumptions that you have. From there, you can decide which particular data to collect and perform the analysis.

This involves a series of steps and the typical data science process can best be summarized by data frameworks such as [OSEMN](https://web.archive.org/web/20211219192027/http://www.dataists.com/2010/09/a-taxonomy-of-data-science/) that encompasses the following steps involving data:
- Obtain
- Scrub
- Explore
- Model
- iNterpret

## Toolkits for Data Science

Common toolkits that are helpful for any data science projects includes the following:
- `NumPy` - Numerical processing
- `Pandas` - Data wrangling
- `Matplotlib` - Data visualization
- `Seaborn` - Data visualization
- `Plotly` - Data visualization
- `Altair` - Data visualization
- `Scikit-learn` - Machine learning

These toolkits provide ready-to-use functions that can be harnessed to retrieve, prepare, visualize and analyze data.
