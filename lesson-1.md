# ðŸ““ Lesson 1 - Getting up to speed with Streamlit

## Installing Streamlit

Streamlit can be installed using `pip` as shown below:

```
pip install streamlit
```

## Creating your first Streamlit app

Before we get into the nuts and bolts of the Streamlit library, let's take a hands-on approach for learning how to use Streamlit. Particularly, creating a simple ==Hello world app== would probably be an expected rite of passage to learning Streamlit!

It's not as difficult as you may think. In fact, it takes only 2 lines of code to do just that!

Click on the *See code* toggle button to reveal the code box:

```Python
import streamlit as st
st.write('Hello world!')
```
