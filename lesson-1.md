# ðŸ““ Lesson 1 - Getting up to speed with Streamlit

## 1.1. What is Streamlit?

Streamlit is a Python library you can use to build interactive data-driven web apps.

## 1.2. Prerequisite

Here's what you need to use Streamlit:
- Have basic Python knowledge.
- Write scripts to perform specific tasks (like taking several Excel files as input and combining them into one).
- Build and grow the Streamlit app line by line instead of starting with a predefined layout (it takes only a few lines of code).
If you can do all this, congratulations! You're ready to plunge into the world of Streamlit.

## 1.3. Setting up your Streamlit workspace

It is typically good practice to house the Streamlit app in their own dedicated conda environment. This way the library dependencies donâ€™t get entangled with other Python libraries used by other apps.

Here, we're going to replicate a Streamlit app from an existing GitHub repo available at https://github.com/dataprofessor/eda-app/.

Particularly, we're going to clone the EDA app from a YouTube tutorial video on *How to Build an EDA app using Pandas Profiling*.

**Step 1.** Create a conda environment

Create a conda environment called eda:

```
conda create -n eda python=3.7.9
```

**Step 2.** Activate the eda environment:

```
conda activate eda
```

**Step 3.** Install prerequisite libraries by downloading the requirements.txt file (it contains the library version numbers):

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dataprofessor/eda-app/main/requirements.txt
```




### Installing Streamlit

Streamlit can be installed using `pip` as shown below:

```
pip install streamlit
```

## 1.4. Creating your first Streamlit app

Before we get into the nuts and bolts of the Streamlit library, let's take a hands-on approach for learning how to use Streamlit. Particularly, creating a simple **Hello world app** would probably be an expected rite of passage to learning Streamlit!

It's not as difficult as you may think. In fact, it takes only 2 lines of code to do just that!

```Python
import streamlit as st
st.write('Hello world!')
```

Here's a line-by-line breakdown of the code:
  1. Import the `streamlit` library as `st` (so that we can later refer to `streamlit` literally as `st` instead of having to type the full word `streamlit`.
  2. Use `st.write` to write a text output and inside the `st.write` command we use the `'Hello world!'` string as the input argument.
